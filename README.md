# Gcode-Modifier
Python little utility to modify some G-codes for custom CNC machines.
The purpose is to make 3D printer G-codes compatible with custom CNC machines.

Here is the list of functions that currently work:

- Delete all comments.
- Delete specified axis command. Default is A for MACH3 machines that doesn't have A Axis for the extruder.

## Requirements

- Have python 2.7 installed.
- Have a G-code generated by any 3D printer slicer or G-code generator. For this application I recommend Slic3r.

## Usage

first you need to clone/download the repository in your computer:

`git clone https://github.com/kitusmark/Gcode-Modifier.git`

Decompress it if you need to, open a terminal and go to the directory:

`python modifier.py`

will print a list of g-codes inside the same directory and expects the name of the file you want to work with.

`python modifier.py file.gcode`

will get the file, parse it and print some statistics.
Then, it will ask you if you want to delete the comments of the file (they start with ";"). After that, it will ask you if you want to delete the A axis of the file.

The output file will be `file_prepared.gcode`

## TO-DO

- Capability to select the output file extension
- Add custom G-codes between layers
- Add custom G-codes between travels
- Improve parsing and statistics
- Add file verification when input file
